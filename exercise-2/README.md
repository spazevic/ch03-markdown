# Exercise-2

As described in the [git-basics
chapter](https://info201.github.io/git-basics.html), you should begin
by forking this repository, then cloning it to your local machine.

In the space below, make a three column table of the current courses
you are taking, with separate columns for course number (in **bold**),
course title (in _italics_), and instructor.

See `complete` branch for answers.

|This is a table|See totally a table|
|---------------|-------------------|
|This is a class|So is this         |
|No bottom      |This is it         |
